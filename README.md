# AlgorithmsAssignment1

Here is what we used to setup and run the program. 

1) Windows Instructions
    A) Downloads
        1) Pycharm
        2) Git
        3) Python 3.7 Interpreter
    B) Once these were downloaded we used the version control of Pycharm in order to download the repository.
        1) This only required https://github.com/BrandonRoyalUCF/AlgorithmsAssignment1.git copied into the clone from URL box.
        2) NOTE: You may need to find your git.exe file and link pycharm to it in the settings.
            A) The default location of git.exe is C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe
    C) Now the project should be open and downloaded. So next is setting up the interpreter.
        1) You will need to open the project settings and select python interpreter from the left hand side
        2) The default location for python 3.7 is C:\Users\<Insert username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Python.exe
    D) With the interpreter set we need to install an external library. To do this return to the project settings.
        1) Under the python interpreter tab click the plus sign on the right hand side of the package manager.
        2) I recommend a search at the top for matplotlib. You only need the package marked matplotlib all of the extras are not necessary.
        3) Click install package at the bottom and wait the install will tell you when it is finished succesfully.
    E) Finally, you will need to configure the script to run. Our script is "assignment1.py". 
        1) Once selected clicking run will run the program and the "performance.png" file will be created.
